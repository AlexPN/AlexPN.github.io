	<h2>Getting Started in Astronomy</h2>
	<h3 id="Start">So, you want to try out astronomy as a hobby?</h3>
	<hr>
		<p>
		I quite frequently hear people saying that they would like to "get into astronomy" after I mention 
		that it is my significantly time-consuming hobby. Mostly, the questions are about the basics which 
		led to the construction of this guide. This guide will, hopefully, cover the absolute basics that
		are necessary to get your bearings in astronomy.
		</p>
		<p>
		Before proceeding further, I feel that it is important to mention that there is significantly more 
		to amateur/hobby astronomy than just "looking at stars". Even with relatively cheap equipment it is 
		possible to obtain incredible images of the sky or observe planets. Just a pair of high-power 
		binoculars is usually just enough to make out Jupiter and Saturn if you can hold them steady enough. 
		As well, if your phone has manual control over the camera and you have an accompanying mount, it is 
		entirely possible to take pictures of the galactic arm if there is limited light pollution.
		</p>
		
		
	<h3 id="TheThreeQuestions">The Three Questions</h3>
	<hr>
		<p>
		With all of this being mentioned, I tend to answer three common questions. Since you are the reader, 
		ask yourself these next three questions if you really are serious about taking on astronomy as a hobby.
		</p>
		
		
		<h4>What would you like to see?</h4>
		
		<p>
		"Stars..." is a poor answer. You would be bored to tears if that was the only thing you could see in 
		the night sky. Amateur astronomy can be categorized into two main categories: 
		<b>observational astronomy</b> and <b>astrophotography</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Observational astronomy involves looking directly through the telescope with your eyes; this is 
		primarily what people think of when they think "astronomy". This is a valid thought; they imagine 
		a large refracting telescope on a tripod and someone observing through an eyepiece at one end. 
		Hey, it's not far from the truth, but there is some explaining that needs to be done. The most 
		common form of observational astronomy is <b>planetary observation</b>. This involves looking at 
		our close neighboring planets, and since these planets are quite bright, this form of astronomy 
		is practically immune to light pollution. It probably is the most common form of amateur astronomy 
		because even just outside a city it is possible to see Jupiter in all of its glory. As well, it is 
		quite awe-inspiring because for the first time you will see that these planets that you heard of 
		since kindergarten are <i>actually</i> there! With proper equipment you will see the great red 
		storm on Jupiter and be able to make out the incredibly flat rings of Saturn (they are only 10m-1km 
		in thickness)! With a little luck, some planning, and patience it is possible to see moons orbiting 
		these planets!
		</p>
		<p>
		I would be tarred and feathered by the community if I said that this is the only thing you can do 
		with observational astronomy. It is also quite popular to observe bright nebulae with proper 
		filtering under low light pollution settings. This is something that I have not really done; I only 
		observed Orion Nebula (M42) and Dumbbell Nebula (M27). You will see Orion's very bright core and 
		Dumbbell will appear as a smoky cloud against background stars. This is something requires more 
		skill and usually better equipment than just beginner planetary observation. Obviously, planetary 
		and nebular observation are not the only things that are possible; nothing stops you from trying to 
		spot comets or try and catch a glimpse of the International Space Station as it passes overhead. 
		There really is an ocean of possibilities with just observational astronomy.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Astrophotography is the other side of the spectrum which involves actually using a camera to take 
		pictures of objects. This is probably an even broader field than observational astronomy and has 
		many different types of equipment sets, each for a specific purpose. One of the first, simplest, 
		and cheapest ways that many get into astrophotography is to take their camera, tripod, and head 
		out to a dark area and take a long exposure of the night sky. This will produce classic 
		"star trails" type photographs where the stars are smeared in a circular fashion. Artistic, but 
		useless if you actually want to get data on an object.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		There are <i>many</i> sub-categories of astrophotography that cover capturing every possible object 
		in the sky. Just to name a few so you can starting searching the interwebs for images: solar, 
		planetary, narrow-band, deep space object (DSO), nebular, comet, wide-field. Speaking of interwebs, 
		a great resource for exclusively astrophoto images is <a href="www.astrobin.com">Astrobin</a>; it 
		is somewhat like a GitHub for images. With this out of the way I will proceed to discuss the more 
		common and cheap astrophotography that you can start with.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Planetary astrophotography is very popular and baisically the same equipment that can be used to 
		observe said planets can also be used to image them with minor to no modifications necessary. Lots 
		of successful images have been captured by just placing a webcam at the eyepiece! It can also get 
		more complicated to the point where you can use CH<sub>4</sub> filters to pull out details in 
		Jupiter's clouds. Planetary astrophotography is a great starting point because you can use your 
		equipment in a dual-purpose way for both observation and photography.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For those hobby photographers reading this, DSLR astrophotography is extremely popular. Pretty much 
		anything can be imaged with a DSLR given you pick the right telescope to complement the camera. As 
		stated before, anything from star-trails to deep space object photography is possible with a DSLR. 
		As I said before, Astrobin is a great resource for determining what targets your equipment can handle 
		because you can search not only objects but gear used as well. This will allow you to get a good idea 
		of what your equipment can image.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		With the above being mentioned, I would like to direct you to an incredibly useful piece of software 
		called <a href="www.stellarium.org">Stellarium</a>. If you decide to enter astronomy, this will be 
		your primary source of determining your schedule and selecting targets. As well, you can adjust light 
		pollution value and set up your equipment in the software to get an idea of how an object will appear.
		</p>
		
		
		<h4>What is your budget?</h4>
		<p>
		Ahh, the important question. I can say with certainty that this is a hobby that is a hole into which 
		you can keep throwing money and the hole will get bigger, but most bugdets can fit you somewhere into 
		the astronomy spectrum. Of course, a $1,000 budget compared to a $10,000 budget will force you to make 
		some compromises. This is a harsh reality that many will face; they would like to try out the hobby, 
		but are scared to take the plunge due to monetary constraints. If this is the case, then I would 
		suggest to try and find a local astronomy club or store that have public events (sadly, there aren't 
		that many) where you can try out multiple types of telescopes and get a better idea of what to expect.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		To start, I would like to discuss observational astronomy. You can start by just picking up a pair of 
		binoculars and affixing them to something sturdy and swivelly. This can get you basic views of the 
		closest planets without much effort. I would suggest buying used telescopes to start because they 
		will be in good condition due to the fact that people in this hobby are typically quite mindful of 
		their equipment. Observational astronomy is fairly cheap to enter because of the fact that you do not 
		need any specialized motorized mount to start. Generally, aperture (the diameter of the primary imaging 
		element) is king; you need to gather as much light as possible and to resolve details on certain objects. 
		As well, I would suggest a Dobsonian (a standard Newtonian telescope on an Alt-Az mount) telescope to 
		begin due to its price to aperture ratio.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Moving to astrophotography, this is the more expensive option if you are starting from scratch. This 
		is also where a general photography hobby will give you an advantage as you can reuse your DSLR camera. 
		Even if you do not have access to a DSLR camera, you can buy a cheap or used DSLR camera as we don't 
		really care about fancy-shmancy features like 128 point auto-focus or image-stabilization support 
		because everything will be done manually. You really only need the camera for the sensor in it. Some 
		hobbyists just buy the cameras and rip out the sensors for their custom built cameras, but that is a 
		topic for another day.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For those who want to do something other than star trails, you will need a tracking mount to compensate 
		for the rotation of the Earth. <i>DO NOT GO CHEAP ON THE MOUNT.</i> Allocate no less than half of your 
		budget on the mount. It is the most important piece of equipment as it will determine the quality of 
		your images. Additionally, make sure to check the carrying capacity of the mount before you place all 
		of your equipment on the mount. I would also recommend checking Astrobin before buying something to 
		determine the quality of the images it takes.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		You might have noticed that I did not mention any kind of telescope for astrophotography because there 
		are as many telescope types for astrophotography as there are German and French names. This is something 
		that depends extremely on the class of objects you wish to image, but if you like you can head over to 
		<a href="comparison.html">Comparison of Telescope Types</a> for my description of common types of telescopes.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Are there any restrictions?</h4>
		<p>
		This may seem like a silly question, but it is one that you need to ask yourself nonetheless. If you live 
		in an apartment in the city, with no access to someplace quieter, astronomy may be out of the question for 
		you. As well, there are many other considerations to take into account. For example, living in the suburbs 
		may limit the amount of light pollution you recieve, making some astronomy possible, but now you have to 
		take into consideration the significant air turbulence caused by rooftops and asphalt during the night. In 
		this case, it may make planetary observation of anything other than Jupiter extremely difficult.
